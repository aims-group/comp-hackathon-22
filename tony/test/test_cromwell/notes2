Why would a tutorial say:

    Ultimately, the workflow should succeed and you'll end up with the following output printed out when Cromwell finishes:

    {
        "myWorkflow.myTask.out": "hello world"
    }

when in reality, it produces 75000 bytes to stderr, 25000 bytes to stdout (in which the above "hello world" is embedded)?  I don't see a --quiet mode, 
but I'm sure I'll learn about it in the "options file" section.
